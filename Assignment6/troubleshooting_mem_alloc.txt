Input:
  Expected input is of 1 of 2 forms:
  N(#1) (#2) ,where (#1) is the process id you want to created
  and (#2) is the total required memory for the process.
  Or
  T(#) ,where (#) is the process id you wish to terminate.

Output:
  Program outputs the step by step processing of the input.
  if a process is successfully allocated, a message will print
  reporting it's id. The contents of memory will print for each
  process added to it.
  If a process fails to allocate memory or free memory, once it has
  been created, a short message will report it's id.
  At the end of input, a short message will display which processes
  failed to free their memory. The contents of the memory will print
  at this time. The contents should be a single hole spanning the
  entirety of the memory space, if it is empty, and all processes
  have been freed. Else, the list will print the left over jobs.
  Finally, a summary table is printed, reporting the total numbers
  of processes reated/terminated, and data allocated/freed.
